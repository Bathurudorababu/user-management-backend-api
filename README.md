# 🧩 User Management Backend API

This is a backend system for managing users, built using **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**. It was created as part of my journey to enhance my backend development skills by building real-world, production-style authentication APIs.

The project includes features such as user registration, login, logout, and fetching the current logged-in user — all secured with JWT authentication.
